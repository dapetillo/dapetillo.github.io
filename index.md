# 🐧 Hi there, <br/> I'm Daniele!

### I'm a data engineer with a focus on Big Data and software development.

### Currently, I work for [dmTECH](https://www.dm-jobs.com/dmTECH/), IT-subsidiary of a big german drugstore chain, [dm-drogerie markt](https://www.dm.de/)

<br>

When I am not working, I am usually training 🏃, reading or walking in parks.\
Some things I enjoy:

- Japanese animation 🍙. An old favourite is [Mawaru-Penguindrum](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum)
- [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/). Do you know [how a wing produces lift?](https://xkcd.com/2678/)
- Philosophy and, in general, knowlegde 💭. Sometimes I write [/essays](http://dapetillo.github.io/essays) on topics I reflect (too much) on
