# 🐧 Hi there, <br/> I'm Daniele Petillo.

### I'm a data engineer with a focus on Big Data and software development.

### Currently, I work for [dmTECH](https://www.dm-jobs.com/dmTECH/), IT-subsidiary of a big german drugstore chain, [dm-drogerie markt](https://www.dm.de/)

<br>

When I am not working, I am usually bouldering 🧗🏻‍♂️, reading or walking in parks.\
I am a sucker for:

- Japanese animation, aka anime 🍙. An old favourite is [Mawaru-Penguindrum](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum)
- [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/). It comes in handy if [you need to threaten a librarian](https://xkcd.com/280/)
- Good old-fashioned books 📖. Two recent favourites are [_The Dispossessed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed) and [_Coders at Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713575-coders-at-work)
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
