### Where I'm from

I was born in Rome where I lived and studied most of my life. Time was good: I hung out with friends in [Trastevere](https://www.google.com/search?q=trastevere&tbm=isch), drank wine near the Colosseum, joined parties on weekends.

In 2014 I joined the [Erasmus+ program](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/) and moved to Germany during my master studies. I was supposed to stay 10 months, but life had other plans: since then I graduated in Physics, learned German and got some jobs with computers.

### What I do now

In November I started to work as a data engineer for [dmTECH](https://www.dm-jobs.com/dmTECH/), the IT-subsidiary company of a large drugstore chain, [dm-drogerie markt](https://www.dm.de/).


### Where I'm at now

üèô Today, I live in Frankfurt. When I'm not working, you can find me in a bookshop or caf√© with a book in my hand, or exercising at the (bouldering) gym.

### What I used to do

I started my career at [Spacenus](https://www.spacenus.com/), a precision farming startup. I worked there for 2.5 years: I learned how to operate the cloud, acquire and manage data and develop machine learning models.

Later on I navigated the exciting but exhausting world of consulting for another 2.5 years, where I worked as a data engineer in the field of space (heard of [MTG](https://www.eumetsat.int/meteosat-third-generation)?) and logistics.
